Preliminary analysis of Ocean Acidification Data From Multiple National Estuary Programs

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our data
archives ensure our science is documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
 CBEP data analysis repositories are divided into from two
 to four sub-folders.  All archives contain at least an "Original_Data" and a
 "Graphics" folder.  The other two folders are included as
 necessary.

- Original Data.  Original data, with a "DATA_SOURCES.md" or "READ ME.txt" file
that documents data sources.
**DATA IN THIS FOLDER IS AS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED OR ACCESSED.** 

- Derived Data.  Data derived from the original raw data.  Includes
documentation of data reorganization steps, either in the form of files (R
notebooks, Excel files, etc.) that embody data transformations, or via another
README.txt file.

- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the data
analysis steps.  

- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of related
graphics, and also raw copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and
\*.pdf formats.  These graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final
State of the Bay graphical layouts.

# Summary of Data Sources
Data was either derived from CBEP OA data analyzed as part of our 2020 State of
the BAy report, or e-mailed to Curtis C. Bohlen by Nick Rosenau of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who was coordinating an effort to
compare carbonate chemistry in National Estuary Waters.

Data sets were gathered through projects coordinated by, and often funded by,
National Estuary Programs around the U.S. Data was assembles by staff at U.S.
EPA.  CBEP did not produce the data, but participated in efforts to consolidate
data analysis and review. CBEP was not the producer of the data, cannot vouch
for its accuracy,  does not hold copyright, and cannot grant useage rights to
others.

Data is provided here on an "AS IS" basis for study only. Data was provided to
CBEP on a preliminary basis as part of collaborative research.  Users are
cautioned that data may not have gone through complete QA/QC processes and may 
contain inaccurate information.
