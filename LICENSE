         Data included in this repository were gathered through projects
         coordinated by, and often funded by, multiple National Estuary
         Programs.  CBEP did not produce the data, but participated in
         efforts to consolidate data analysis and review.  CBEP was not the 
         producer of the data,  does not hold copyright thereto, and
         cannot grant useage rights to others.
         
         Data is provided here on an "AS IS" basis for study only. Data
         was provided to CBEP on a preliminary basis as part of collaborative
         research developing methods to analyse acidification data from
         coastal estuaries.  Users are cautioned that data may not have gone
         through complete QA/QC processes.
