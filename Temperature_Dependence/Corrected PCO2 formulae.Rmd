# Temperature Corrected pCO2 
It turns out pCO~2~ is not a simple measure of the concentration (or activity)
of CO~2~ in water, as it is strongly influenced by temperature.  Even at a fixed
concentration of CO~2~ in seawater, there will be fluctuations in pCO~2~ due
only to changes in temperature.

Here is an informal argument for why this is true:  At higher temperatures,
CO~2~ is less soluble in sea water.  At equilibrium, partitioning of CO~2~
between atmosphere and ocean water will shift more CO~2~ to the atmosphere, thus
raising the partial pressure of CO~2~ in the atmosphere that equilibrates with
the CO~2~ in the water.

More formally, carbon dioxide (gas) in the atmosphere is in thermodynamic
equilibrium with [CO~2~] in the water, (where [CO~2~] here (by convention)
refers to the sum of activities of CO~2~ and H~2~CO~3~ in solution.

$$ CO_{2(g)}
\stackrel {K_{0}} {\longleftrightarrow} 
[CO_{2(aq.)}] $$ 


Thus at equilibrium,  

$$fCO_{2} = [CO_{2(aq.)}] / K_{0}$$  

where $fCO_{2}$, the *fugacity* of CO~2~, is "virtually equal to the partial
pressure." Unfortunately, $K_{0}$ is not constant, but depends on temperature
and salinity. One semi-empirical model for that relationship is the following
(From Weiss 1974 but also presented elsewhere):

$$ ln~K_{0} = -60.2409 + 93.4517(100/T) + 23.3585 \times ln(T/100) + 
S \times [0.023517 - 0.023656 \times (T/100) + 0.0047036 \times(T/100)^2] $$  

(Note that temperatures need to be expressed in Kelvin)

# Takehashi et al. 2002 Relationships
Here we follow a formula for calculating a "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~, which
is derived from methods in  Takehashi et al. 2002. The "temperature corrected"
version adjusts for the thermodynamic effect of temperature on pCO~2~ just
discussed.

Takahashi et al. 2002 used direct calculation of "temperature corrected" pCO~2~
as a surrogate for changes in CO~2~ concentration, and conversely, estimates of
"expected" thermal pCO~2~, as estimates of the magnitude of the fluctuations in
pCO~2~ one would expect to see due to temperature alone, if there were no
changes in [CO~2~].

The Takehashi et al. 2002 equations are as follows:

## "Expected pCO~2~" at Observed Temperature
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{obs}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{obs}- T_{mean}))$$

## "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{mean}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{mean}- T_{obs})$$  

This is approach addresses the thermal dependence of pCO~2~ by calculating what
the observed pCO~2~ would have been at some reference temperature (rather than
estimating [CO~2~] as Weiss did).  Here we use $12 ^{\circ} C$ as our reference
temperature.

Equations from Takehashi et al. 2002 do not LOOK similar to Weiss's equations,
but they are nearly equivalent. At fixed salinity near full sea water, they
essentially differ only by a constant.
