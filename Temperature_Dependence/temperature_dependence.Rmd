# Introduction  
It turns out pCO~2~ is not a simple measure of the concentration (or activity)
of CO~2~ in water, as it is strongly influenced by temperature.  Even at a fixed
concentration of CO~2~ in seawater, there will be fluctuations in pCO~2~ due
only to changes in temperature.

Here is an informal argument for why this is true:  At higher temperatures, CO~2~
is less soluble in sea water.  At equilibrium, partitioning of CO~2~ between
atmosphere and ocean water will shift more CO~2~ to the atmosphere, thus raising
the partial pressure of CO~2~ in the atmosphere that equilibrates with the CO~2~
in the water.

More formally, carbon dioxide (gas) in the atmosphere is in thermodynamic
equilibrium with [CO~2~] in the water, (where [CO~2~] refers to the
sum of activities of CO~2~ and H~2~CO~3~ in solution).

$$ CO_{2(g)} \stackrel{K_{0}}{\longleftrightarrow} [CO_{2(aq.)}]$$

Thus at equilibrium,
$$ fCO_{2} =[CO_{2(aq.)}] / K_{0}$$
where $fCO_{2}$, the *fugacity* of CO~2~, is "virtually equal to the partial
pressure." Unfortunately, $K_{0}$ is not constant, but depends on temperature
and salinity. One model for that relationship is the following (From Weiss 1974
but also cited elsewhere):

$$ ln~K_{0} = -60.2409 + 93.4517(100/T) + 23.3585 \times ln(T/100) + 
S * [0.023517 - 0.023656 * (T/100) + 0.0047036 *(T/100)^2] $$   

(Note that temperatures need to be expressed in Kelvin)

# What do those equations imply?
We will make a graphic that shows the magnitude of the conversion factor
($1/K_{0}$), which converts from observed $pCO_{2} \approx fCO_{2}$ to
$[CO_{2}]$ (from the second equation, above) over the range of temperatures and
salinities we are mostly concerned with.  This shows how measured pCO~2~ will
vary based on temperature and salinity alone -- even without actual
changes in the concentration of CO~2~.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
Tc <- seq(1,20,0.5) 
S <- seq(20,35, 0.5)

test <- expand.grid(Tc=Tc, S=S) %>%
  mutate(T = Tc+273.15) %>%
  mutate(lnK = -60.2409 +
                 9345.17/T +
                 23.3585 * log(T/100) +
              S * (0.023517 - 
                   0.023656 * (T/100) + 
                   0.0047036 *(T/100)^2)) %>%
  mutate(K=exp(lnK), invK = 1/K)

                      type = scale_fill_brewer) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*degree~C*')')) +
  ylab('Salinity (ppt)')
```

Over the range of temperatures and salinities we are considering, the effect
is mostly due to temperature -- if only because temperatures vary over ~ 20 C,
while salinities vary only from ~ 22 ppt to about 32 ppt.  The overall effect of
temperature and salinity could lead to a change in observed pCO~2~ of about a
factor of two.

# Takehashi et al. 2002 Relationships
Takahashi et al. 2002 Used direct calculation of "temperature corrected" pCO~2~
as a surrogate for changes in CO~2~ concentration, and conversely, estimates of
"expected" thermal pCO~2~, as estimates of the magnitude of the fluctuations in
pCO~2~ one would expect to see due to temperature alone, if there were no
changes in [CO~2~].


The Takehashi et al. 2002 equations are as follows:

#### "Expected pCO~2~" at Observed Temperature
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{obs}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{obs}- T_{mean})$$

#### "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{mean}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{mean}- T_{obs})$$

Equations from Takehashi et al. 2002 do not LOOK similar to Weiss's equation, but
they are nearly equivalent. At fixed salinity near full sea water, their predictions
for observed pCO~2~ essentially differ from what the Weiss 1974 equations predict 
only by a constant. This approximate equivalence might not be sufficient for careful
work in the open ocean, but in the context of the large fluctuations in conditions
in coastal estuaries, the inaccuracies will vanish amid other sources of variation.

# Real Data
We use the Casco Bay data derived from the EPA collection of OA data from
several NEPs.  This data includes calculation of temperature corrected pCO~2~.
We chose these data to start from (rather than our own internal CBEP version of
the data) for consistency, and to test code for use with other NEP datasets.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
the_data <-  read_csv("CB_oa_data.csv", 
     col_types = cols(X1 = col_skip())) %>%
  mutate(Year = format(DateTime, format = '%Y'))
```

## Temperature correction depends on temperature data
We have a couple of anomolous high temperature observations that appear to be
outliers.  They may  represent a very low tide event on a hot summer afternoon,
but I have not investigated further. I leave the data in the data, but note
these values to make the point that corrected values depend on both accurate
pCO~2~ data and accurate temperature data.

```{r}
a <- which(the_data$Temp_meas==max(the_data$Temp_meas, na.rm = TRUE))
the_data[(a-2):(a+2),]
rm(a)
```

## Calculations
We calculate both the "thermal-only" and "temperature corrected" time series as calculated in Takehashi et al.  

1.  Calculate the expected thermal-only variation in pCO~2~.  This value (called
"co2_thermal' here) is based on the average observed pCO~2~.  Since sampling is
seasonally incomplete, this average is really just a reference value.  The
logic, however, is that if the molar concentration of CO~2~ in the water column
were constant, we would still see seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO~2~,
simply because the solubility of CO~2~ is temperature dependent.

2.  Calculate a "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~ value ("co2_corr"). This is the
converse of (1.). Here it provides a trace of changes in pCO~2~ that "would have
happened" in the absence of temperature changes.  These reflect changes in the
concentration of CO~2~, which reflect a combination of biology and diffusion of
CO~2~ between ocean and atmosphere and advection past the sensor suite by tides
and currents. Here we adjust pCO~2~ to a "standard temperature" of 12 degrees C.
This is slightly warmer than our observed average temperatures, and matches the
temperature average used  temperatures.  Results should exactly match the value
of CO2_Tcorr12.

The logic is that if there were no biology (and no advection or diffusion
between surface waters and the atmosphere), then co2_meas would equal
co2_thermal, and co2_corr would be a flat line (within measurement error).
Neither is the case (see graphics, below) providing strong evidence that CO~2~
behavior in Casco Bay is influenced by system metabolism.

```{r}
t_ref = 12
(t_mean = mean(the_data$Temp_meas, na.rm=TRUE))
(co2_mean = mean(the_data$CO2_meas, na.rm=TRUE))

the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(co2_thermal =  co2_mean*exp(0.0423*(Temp_meas-t_mean))) %>%
  mutate(co2_corr =  CO2_meas*exp(0.0423*(t_ref-Temp_meas)))
```
Thankfully, our calculations of temperature corrected pCO~2~  (cco2_corr) match
the values in the data from EPA (CO2_Tcorr12).

The average temperature in our data is about 11.5C, partly because we have
relatively little winter data.   More interesting, the average observed pCO~2~
is about 575 micro-atmospheres -- well above atmospheric averages of about 400
micro-atmospheres.

A quick check shows that the calculations in (2.), above, produced data that is
linearly related to the calculations of [CO~2~] we ran based on the
thermodynamic equilibria. These two ways of thinking about temperature
dependence of pCO~2~ or [CO~2~] will give (nearly) identical results (subject
only to a scaling factor).

# Exploratory Graphics
The following graphics show how the Takahashi et al. corrections look in Casco Bay.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(x=CO2_meas, y=CO2_Tcorr12, color = Temp_meas)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept=0) +
  geom_text(aes(x=1000, y=1200, label = '1:1 Line'), hjust = 0) +
  xlab(expression(Measured~pCO[2])) +
  ylab(expression(Temperature~Corrected~pCO[2])) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Conceptually, the "correction" is adjusting for the natural effect of solubility
on pCO~2~. Since pCO~2~ is higher at higher temperatures (Co~2~ is less soluble)
the correction RAISES the value at low temperatures, and it LOWERS the value at
high temperatures.

Overall it reduces apparent swings in pCO~2~, as the next plot confirms.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(x=DateTime)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_meas), color='blue', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_Tcorr12), color = 'green', alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab('Date and Time') +
  ylab(expression(pCO[2])) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct('2018-06-01'), y=1250, label='Observed = blue\nCorrected = Green')) +
  theme_minimal()
```
The net effect is to somewhat flatten out the seasonal swings in CO~2~.  Diurnal
swings look less affected, although that is hard to evaluate from this plot. 

## If there were no biology, what would we see?
Here we compare predicted based on temperature alone, versus what we actually observed. 

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(DateTime, group = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_meas), color = 'blue', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=co2_thermal), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct('2018-06-01'), y=1250, label='Observed = blue\nThermal Only = Black')) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('pCO2')
```
In spring we see pCO~2~ levels well below what we would expect only due to
temperature, while by late summer and fall, water temperatures are beginning to
drop again, but pCO~2~ stays high.  Also, it looks like diurnal fluctuations in
pCO~2~ are substantially greater than would be predicted based on temperature
alone.

That suggests:
1.  biological activity is removing CO2 from the water column in the spring,
and returning it to the water column in the late summer and fall.
2.  Biological activity, perhaps related to photosynthesis, magnifies diurnal
patterns.
